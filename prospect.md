If you are interested in joining the lab, please send me an email.  You can use the form below.  Please provide information on any relevant background experience you have (e.g., if you can program and in what languages, if you've been involved in research before) and try to give an idea of the kind of questions you are interested in.  Please also include a resume/CV.

I look forward to hearing from you!
